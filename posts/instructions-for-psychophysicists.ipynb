      "* it is easy to create a simple psychophysical experiment using a combination of PsychoPy and MotionClouds. Simply download the standalone psychopy binary for your computer and try to load the example script psychopy_competing.py.\n",
      "* for this, you may:\n",
      " 1. clone / download the [MC repository](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/MotionClouds) on github.\n",
      " 1. download [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/installation.html)\n",
      "* then, open the psychopy_competing.py file in the editor (the so-called \"PsychoPy Coder\")\n",

      "* it seems I have a slight bias for UP movements as the contrast of equal probability seems inferior to 1/2 (a proper analysis would necessitate a fit).\n",
