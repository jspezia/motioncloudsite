      "\n",
      "MotionClouds are parameterized stimuli with controlled motion content and no spatial coherence.  They are precisely tuned in the frequency space.\n",
      "\n",
      "* A full description can be found in Paula S. Leon, Ivo Vanzetta, Guillaume S. Masson, Laurent U. Perrinet. Motion Clouds: Model-based stimulus synthesis of natural-like random textures for the study of motion perception, URL . Journal of Neurophysiology, 107(11):3217--3226, 2012, see  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22423003 or http://jn.physiology.org/content/107/11/3217 .\n",

      "```\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## installing and running the python scripts\n",
      "This package consists of:\n",
      "\n",
      "* ```MotionClouds.py``` : the API with all the math and display routines,\n",
      "* ```test_*.py``` : different types of stimuli are tested,\n",
      "* ```experiment_*py``` : different experiments.\n",
      "* ```fig_*py``` : different scripts used to generate wiki pages.\n",
      "* ```figures``` : resulting figures of tests and experiments (as set in the variable ```MotionClouds.figpath```.\n",
      "* ```Makefile``` : a GNUmake file to edit files ```make edit```, generate figures ```make figures``` or compile the documentation ```make doc```.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Installation\n",
      "\n",
      "*   MotionClouds consist of a one-file python script: Installation consists simply in downloading the ```MotionClouds.py``` file which contains all routines to compute and use the MotionClouds textures. This script uses python (http://python.org) which comes (pre-installed /  easy to download and install) on many operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "* MotionClouds may easily be installed using\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "    pip install MotionClouds\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "* Other solutions consist to simply grab this file at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuralEnsemble/MotionClouds/master/MotionClouds.py and to use it along with the examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Installation has some dependencies:\n",
      " 1. mandatory: ```numpy``` is the core library used to compute textures,\n",
      " 1. optional: ```mayavi``` is used to visualize envelopes,\n",
      " 1. optional: ```ffmpeg``` is used to generate movies.\n",
      " 1. optional: ```matplotlib```, ```scipy``` (with PIL support) and ```imagemagick``` are used to generate figures in the documentation.\n",
      " 1. optional: ```progressbar``` for displaying progress of encoding.\n",
      " 1. optional: ```texlive-latex-recommended  latexmk latexdiff``` to compile the documentation\n",
      " 1. optional: ```PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate glumpy``` to display MotionClouds online\n",
      "\n",
      "* These dependencies may  be easily met using the dedicated scripts:\n",
      "\n",
      " * For MacOsX, first install command line tools by typing the ```git``` command in the terminal (a pop-up message should happen if these tools are not installed). Then issue the following command in the terminal:\n",
      "```\n",
      "    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuralEnsemble/MotionClouds/master/install/install_dependencies_macosx.sh |sh\n",
      "```\n",
      " * For Debian-like systems, issue the following command in the terminal\n",
      "```\n",
      "    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NeuralEnsemble/MotionClouds/master/install/install_dependencies_debian.sh -O - |sh\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, these line of code may be copy-and-pasted in your terminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "##testing\n",
      "\n",
      "* To test the basic functionality of Motion Clouds, try in the terminal:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "python -c'import MotionClouds as mc; fx, fy, ft = mc.get_grids(mc.N_X, mc.N_Y, mc.N_frame); z = mc.envelope_gabor(fx, fy, ft)'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "* other sources exist to get a stable release, such as ModelDb (http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=146953).\n",
      "\n",
      "* This was tested on several MacOsX/Mavericks 64bit machines and on ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Debian squeezy 64bit machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "* If that fails, we will be happy to help out, so send an e-mail to [laurent.perrinet@univ-amu.fr](mailto://laurent.perrinet@univ-amu.fr)."
